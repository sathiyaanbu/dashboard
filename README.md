### Getting Started

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.

#### Familiar with Git?

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/sathiyaanbu/dashboard
> cd dashboard
> npm install
> node server.js
```

#### Not Familiar with Git?

Click (https://github.com/sathiyaanbu/dashboard) then download the .zip file. Extract the contents of the zip file, then open your terminal, change to the project directory, and:

Note: For security reason config file is not added in the git.
So it will show error like this:

```
